# Automated spinning

With Python and Selenium package and webdriver made script for automated spinning at Circle K
Latvia Lottery wheel (https://www.laimesrats.lv)

## Get started

There are three webdrivers for Google Chrome in repository:
* For **Windows** (chromedriver-win.exe)
* For **Mac** (chromedriver-mac)
* For **Raspberry Pi 3 B+** (chromedriver-pi)

Script will automatically detect your system and use the proper webdriver file.

**_numbers.py_** file is for numbers to be each written in new line. Please do not leave empty lines in this file as it will lead to errors (a bug that I will investigate).

Make sure you have installed Selenium package.

_**index.py**_ is the file you need to execute.
